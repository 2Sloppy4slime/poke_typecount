# poke_typecount
small script I made to count the types of a list of pokemons <br>
this is made to accomodate only a Captialized, spaceless, list of pokemons because I needed it quickly. Will probably not update if not needed again. <br>
special forms may be accessed through a number system (as in 2Raticate is Alolan Raticate and Raticate is the base form, inputting a wrong form will not return any pokemon) <br>
the numbers in parentheses mean pokemon who have that type as secondary typing <br>
